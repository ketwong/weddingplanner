👰🤵 Let's get this party started! Here's how to create your guest list and send out save-the-date cards for our wedding:

1️⃣ First, brainstorm who you want to invite to our special day. This is your chance to celebrate with family, friends, and loved ones! 🥳

3️⃣ Decide how many guests you can realistically invite based on your budget and venue capacity. 🤑

4️⃣ Collect contact info for your guests, including full names, addresses, and email addresses. 📲

5️⃣ Once you confirm the date of our wedding, design and send out save-the-date cards to give everyone plenty of notice. 💌

6️⃣ Send the cards via mail or email, and don't forget to include the date, location, and other important details. 📬
