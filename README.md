## Wedding Plan

The Wedding plan for this is outlined as follows:

1. [Set a budget and determine who will be contributing financially to the wedding.](#setabudget)
2. Choose a potential date range for the wedding and begin researching venues that are available during that time period.
3. Narrow down venue options based on location, capacity, and cost.
4. Once a venue has been chosen, book it and begin planning the rest of the wedding around that date.
5. Start creating a guest list and sending out save-the-date cards once the date has been confirmed.
6. Choose a wedding theme and color scheme, and begin coordinating decorations, floral arrangements, and other aesthetic details.
7. Select a wedding dress and begin coordinating bridesmaid dresses and groomsmen attire.
8. Determine the food and beverage menu for the reception, and arrange for catering or a food and beverage service.
9. Book a photographer and videographer to capture the special moments of the day.
10. Choose a wedding cake and/or dessert options and arrange for a baker or caterer to provide them.
11. Arrange for entertainment, such as a DJ or live band, for the reception.
